**Keep Them Small** is a HTML5 game about preventing growing circles from getting to big. 
_Currently it only works on mobile devices. _

It's a project on which I work on when I'm bored - meaning when I don't have access to a computer. So this game is completely written on a mobile phone. That's the reason why the code is not formatted.
