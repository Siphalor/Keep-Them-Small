**Keep Them Small** is a HTML5 mobile web game about preventing growing circles from getting to big. 

*Currently it only works on mobile devices.*

You can play the latest release [here](https://siphalor.lima-city.de/kts/play.php).

For more information about the game and the usage permission please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Siphalor/Keep-Them-Small/wiki). 

It's a project on which I work on when I'm bored - meaning when I don't have access to a computer. So this game is completely written with a mobile phone. That's the reason why the code is not formatted very well.
