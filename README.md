# Keep Them Small
**Keep Them Small** is a HTML5 game about preventing growing circles from getting to big. 
*Currently it only works on mobile devices.*

For more information about the game you can take a look at the [wiki](www.github.com/Siphalor/Keep-Them-Small/wiki). 

It's a project on which I work on when I'm bored - meaning when I don't have access to a computer. So this game is completely written on a mobile phone. That's the reason why the code is not formatted.
